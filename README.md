The project include three files i.e media.py , entertainment_center.py , fresh_tomatoes.py
-media.py file is a movie class file,in which properties of a movie are that need to be encapsuated in a movie object such as movie titles,story line, movie poster and movie movie trailer
-entertainment_center.py is a file in which different movie objects are created, objects call the media.movie() constructor to save its values
-to help you generate a website that displays these movies, we have provided a starter code repository that contains a Python module called fresh_tomatoes.py. To get started, fork this repository to create your own copy in GitHub. Then clone your ud036_StarterCode repository to work on this project locally on your computer. The fresh_tomatoes.py module has a function called open_movies_page that takes in one argument, which is a list of movies, and creates an HTML file which will display all of your favorite movies.

Run the file:
Download all the files under one folder, compile all the files present in the folder then run the entertainment_center.py file.
if using linux : python entertainment_center.py
